# Regression Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive regression testing suite for the FormaLLM pipeline to prevent quality degradation and track improvements over time.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Fixed TLC Directory Collision Bug ✅

**Problem**: All tests were failing because TLC (the TLA+ model checker) tried to write to the same temporary directory, causing race conditions.

**Solution**: Modified `steps/evaluate_generated_step.py` to use the `-metadir` flag with unique directories for each model:

```python
metadir = eval_output_dir / f"{model_name}_metadir"
result = subprocess.run(
    ["tlc", "-nowarning", "-metadir", str(metadir), "-config", str(cfg_path), str(tla_path)],
    capture_output=True, text=True
)
```

**Impact**: Tests can now run without crashing, allowing us to see actual evaluation results.

### 2. Created Regression Testing Script ✅

**File**: `test_regression.py`

**Features**:
- Compares current evaluation results against a saved baseline
- Detects and reports:
  - ❌ **Regressions**: Tests that passed before but fail now
  - 🎉 **Improvements**: Tests that failed before but pass now
  - ➕ **New tests**: Tests added since baseline
  - ➖ **Removed tests**: Tests removed since baseline
- Supports verbose mode to show all test results
- Can save/update baselines
- Provides clear exit codes for CI/CD integration

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Run regression tests
python test_regression.py

# Show all results, not just changes
python test_regression.py --verbose

# Update baseline after improvements
python test_regression.py --save-baseline

# Compare specific files
python test_regression.py --baseline old.csv --current new.csv
```

### 3. Established Initial Baseline ✅

**File**: `outputs/baseline_results.csv`

**Content**: Saved results from current pipeline run
- 26 models tested
- 0 passing (expected - LLM not yet generating valid TLA+ specs)
- This baseline allows us to track future improvements

### 4. Integrated into Workflow ✅

**Modified**: `run.sh`

**Integration**: Regression tests now run automatically after each pipeline execution:

```bash
./run.sh
# ... pipeline runs ...
# Regression tests run automatically
# Report shows improvements/regressions
# Offers to update baseline if needed
```

### 5. Created Comprehensive Documentation ✅

**Files**:
- `TESTING.md` - Complete regression testing guide with:
  - Quick start instructions
  - Workflow examples
  - Best practices for baseline management
  - CI/CD integration examples
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Future enhancement ideas

- `README.md` - Updated with regression testing section showing:
  - Overview of testing capabilities
  - Quick usage examples
  - Workflow example
  - Link to detailed documentation

## Current Status

### What Works
- ✅ TLC evaluation runs without directory collisions
- ✅ Regression test script fully functional
- ✅ Baseline established and tracked
- ✅ Automated testing integrated into workflow
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation created

### What Needs Work
- ⚠️ **All tests currently fail** - This is expected! The LLM is not yet generating valid TLA+ specifications
- 🎯 **Next step**: Improve prompt generation to get at least one model to pass

## How to Use

### For Daily Development

1. Make changes to the pipeline (prompts, models, etc.)
2. Run: `./run.sh`
3. Review regression test results
4. If improvements detected: `python test_regression.py --save-baseline`

### For Experimentation

```bash
# Try a different model
export LLM_MODEL="codellama"
./run.sh

# See how it compares to baseline
python test_regression.py

# Don't save baseline unless improvements are verified
```

### For Quality Assurance

```bash
# Before committing changes
./run.sh
python test_regression.py

# Exit code 0 = no regressions
# Exit code 1 = regressions detected (investigate!)
```

## Metrics to Track

As you improve the pipeline, track:

1. **Pass Rate**: `passing_tests / total_tests`
   - Current: 0/26 (0%)
   - Target: >50% initially, >80% eventually

2. **Improvement Rate**: Number of new passing tests per change
   - Goal: Steady improvement with each iteration

3. **Regression Rate**: Number of new failing tests per change
   - Goal: 0 (no regressions)

## Example Future Workflow

```bash
# Week 1: Initial state
./run.sh  # 0/26 passing

# Week 2: Improved prompts
vim steps/prompt_step.py
./run.sh  # 3/26 passing (+3 improvements)
python test_regression.py --save-baseline

# Week 3: Better few-shot examples
vim outputs/train.json
./run.sh  # 8/26 passing (+5 improvements)
python test_regression.py --save-baseline

# Week 4: Different model
export LLM_MODEL="codellama"
./run.sh  # 12/26 passing (+4 improvements)
python test_regression.py --save-baseline
```

## Next Steps

To get tests passing, focus on:

1. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Review `steps/prompt_step.py`
   - Improve system prompts
   - Add better instructions for TLA+ generation

2. **Few-Shot Examples**:
   - Review `outputs/train.json`
   - Add more diverse examples
   - Ensure examples show proper TLA+ structure

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Try different LLMs
   - Compare results across models
   - Use regression tests to track which models work best

4. **TLA+ Validation**:
   - Ensure generated specs have proper module names
   - Verify Init/Next operators are generated
   - Check that constants are properly defined

## Benefits of This System

### For Development
- ✅ Immediate feedback on changes
- ✅ Confidence that improvements are real
- ✅ Easy to experiment without fear of breaking things

### For Quality
- ✅ Prevents accidental regressions
- ✅ Tracks progress over time
- ✅ Provides metrics for reporting

### For Collaboration
- ✅ Clear success criteria
- ✅ Automated checks for pull requests
- ✅ Easy onboarding (run `./run.sh`)

## Files Changed

1. `steps/evaluate_generated_step.py` - Fixed TLC directory collision
2. `test_regression.py` - New regression testing script
3. `run.sh` - Integrated regression testing
4. `TESTING.md` - New comprehensive testing guide
5. `README.md` - Added regression testing section
6. `outputs/baseline_results.csv` - New baseline file

## Conclusion

The regression testing infrastructure is now complete and ready to use! The system will help ensure that:

1. Changes to the pipeline don't introduce regressions
2. Improvements are tracked and celebrated
3. The project maintains quality as it evolves

**Current baseline**: 0/26 passing (expected)
**Next goal**: Get first passing test by improving prompt generation!
